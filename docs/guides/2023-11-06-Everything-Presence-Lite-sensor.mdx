# Everything Presence Lite sensor

The [Everything Presence Lite](https://shop.everythingsmart.io/products/everything-presence-lite) sensor was release in October 2023 for £28 or around $30 (plus postage) from [Everything Smart Technology](https://shop.everythingsmart.io).

## Features

* Precise mmWave radar motion detector
* Light luminosity (or room brightness) sensor
* WiFi
* Bluetooth repeater/Home Assistant proxy
* ESP32 (can be extended using GPIO pins)
* 3D printed case
* USB-C

## Pros

* Relatively inexpensive way to add presence, motion and room brightness data to your smart home
* Much more sensitive than a regular PIR motion sensor and can easily detect people that are sitting still
* Can perform automatons based on sensor data, such as turning on/off lights
* Beta zones feature can perform different actions/automations based on where the motion/presence was detected
* Can see through thin walls
* Can extend your Home Assistant Bluetooth range via proxy
* Good quality braided cable
* Works with Home Assistant via WiFi
* USB-C powered

## Cons

* Not always in stock since they're a relative small startup business
* Setting up different zones can be tricky, as it's a beta feature requiring trial and error defining coordinates in 3D space by using start and end X/Y millimetre values
* It's capable of detecting small movements such as breathing, however I was able to sit still long enough for it to give me a false positive and detect me as away (though sensitivity can be calibrated, to fix this)
* Only available in white

## Home Assistant automations

Note: you'll need to paste this in YAML mode then switch back to the visual editor you should then be able to update the device/light IDs.
