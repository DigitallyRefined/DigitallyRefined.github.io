## Home Assistant integration

It's compatible both with the built-in Home Assistant [ZHA integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/) and the [Zigbee2MQTT plug-in](https://github.com/zigbee2mqtt/hassio-zigbee2mqtt#installation).

The video and this article previously mentioned that the tVOC sensor was not available via ZHA, but it was [added in a later release](https://github.com/zigpy/zha-device-handlers/pull/3801).
